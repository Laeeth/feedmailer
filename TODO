Frontend
* html - design, layout, formatting, etc
* nice formatting of digest_days

Backend
* Feed interval groups -- on feed details set either interval group or custom interval

* Feed._recent_items: used to avoid resending items after title or link change
  currently: only item_link, but if dev changes link we are screwed. Todo: add
  link and title-hash to _recent_items
